# Data_Visualization
Project two from 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes

This project involves data visualization.

Exercise 15-10, practicing with both libraries: Try using matplotlib to make a die-rolling visualization, and use Pygal to make the visualization for a random walk. I'm calling the matplotlib exercise 15-10a and the Pygal problem 15-10b. I've included my notes for how to lay out 15-10a, as well as the graph and the die class that Eric Matthes demonstrated in the book.

For 15-10b, doing a random walk with Pygal, I have (at the moment), an incorrect result. I'm getting a memory error and think the proble is that I haven't set a limit yet on the number of points.
