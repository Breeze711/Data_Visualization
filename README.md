# Data_Visualization
Project two from 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes

This project involves data visualization.

Exercise 15-10, practicing with both libraries: Try using matplotlib to make a die-rolling visualization, and use Pygal to make the visualization for a random walk. I'm calling the matplotlib exercise 15-10a and the Pygal problem 15-10b. I've included my notes for how to lay out 15-10a, as well as the graph and the die class that Eric Matthes demonstrated in the book. I could not successfully get a random walk to 'go' in Pygal, so am now trying to do an xy chart. 

For 15-10b, I have (at the moment), an incorrect result. When I try to open my svg file in a browser, I get the following error: 'This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.' I have googled this error message, but am not finding anything that makes sense. We will call this a work in progress.
